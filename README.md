## Learning Objectives

* 


## Outline / Notes

*  I like the idea of having this lab be more involved like [this](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-blackjack-lab). In fact, we can steal a lot of what's going on that linked lab (blackjack). I'm just not a huge fan of the instructions and the tests actually don't line up a lot with what's being asked in the instruction.
* Maybe we can break the blackjack thing into two labs? That might not be a bad idea. Where we have the devices the various classes for it here in this lab and then in the one after this, they are required to setup a UI.
